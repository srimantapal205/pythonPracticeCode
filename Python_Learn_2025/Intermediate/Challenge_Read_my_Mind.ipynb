    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate a secret number:** Write a program that uses Python's built-in random module to create a random\n",
    "integer between 1 and 100. This mystical number will be the secret that you must uncover.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set your attempts:** Allow the user only 5 attempts to guess the secret number correctly. Keep track of the\n",
    "remaining attempts as the game progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accept user input:** Prompt the user to enter their guess for the secret number. Make sure to convert their input\n",
    "into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide hints:** For each incorrect guess, give the user a hint to guide their next attempt. Inform them if they need\n",
    "to guess higher or lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Track attempts:** With each guess, decrement the number of remaining attempts.\n",
    "Determine the outcome: If the user successfully guesses the secret number within the allowed attempts,\n",
    "congratulate them on their victory! If the user fails to guess the number after 5 attempts, reveal the secret\n",

    "computer's digital mind. Will you triumph over the challenge, or will the enigma remain unsolved? The fate of the\n",
